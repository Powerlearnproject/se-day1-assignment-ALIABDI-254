Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

*Software engineering is using code for designing, developing and maintaining software products. It is used to create applications, websites andany other things used in the technology industry.*

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Object oriented programming were developed in the 1970s enabling code reusability and modularity
- Establishment of software engineering as a field of study in the 1960â€™s.
- Computers with graphical user interface are developed in the 1980's.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Planning. Involves defining the goals of the project, timeliness and the resources required.
- Requirements.Gathering information and features needed in developing the software.
- Designing the software architecture, components and user interfaces as required. Developing the software through coding.
- Testing. Analysing the performance and the functionality of 5he software developed.
- Deployment. Releasing the software to users.
- Maintenance. Providing ongoing support, updates and fixes to the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

*Waterfall methodology involves development in a certain order flowing downwards where one task is finished before moving to the next one. It follows a certain prescribed pattern. It is best suited for projects with repeatable and predictable development.*

*Agile is a flexible method allowing collaboration, change and response to feedback. It is more efficient and responsive to user needs.*

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software developer- writes code and implements software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer- tests software to check the quality.
- Project Manager- oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects  


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. 
- IDES provide a place to write, debug and test code. eg, vscode.
- VCS are for tracking changes to code and enabling teams to work together. eg, git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
*Common challenges include short delivery times, changes in the project requirements and technical dept. These challenges can be overcome by using agile methodologies, reassessing the project deadlines frequently and prioritisation of tasks.*


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing is testing individual components of a Software.
- Integration testing is testing interactions between different components of a Software.
- system testing is testing the whole software system as a while.
- Acceptance testing is testing a software to see if it meets the needs of the users.
- Testing is important because it helps in identifying and fixing the problems thus ensuring that the developed software is of great value  


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

*Prompt Engineering is giving instructions to get the best results from an AI model. It is important because it helps to put clear and precise instructions for required answers.*
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Kenya
- Improved prompt:  tourist sites in Kenya.
- The first prompt is vagus and ambiguous while the second one gives precise instructions of what you want.
